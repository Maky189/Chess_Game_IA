# Chess Game IA

This is still a work in progress, but the goal is to create a chess game with an AI opponent and a Multiplayer mode too.

Please if you want to suport me and help me with this project, download the game and test it. I will be very grateful for any feedback.
Find bugs and report them, or just tell me what you think about the game and what could be improved.
 Also, if you want to help me with the code, please do it. I will be very grateful for any help.

## Known bugs:
# Principal bugs:
- The en passant move in 3D game mode is working but the pawn that made that move any piece that eliminated it is not moving anymore. I don't know why.
- The en passant move in 2D game mode is not working. It just shows the move but it doesn't capture the piece.

## Other bugs:
- The AI is not very smart yet. It is just a random move generator. I will improve it in the future.
- The game is not very optimized. 
- The game is not very user friendly.
- The game is not very pretty.
- The game is not very responsive.
- The game is not very mobile friendly.
- The game is not very accessible.
- Pawn promotion is not implemented yet.

## To run the game:
1. Clone the repository.
2. build the project with Gradle and run it with the command line:
```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```
